To connect to the mysql database

sudo isql symetrica


List all of the tables:
show tables;

We can show the structure of the table using the "desc" command, so for the "Occupancies" table:
desc Occupancies;

Display the first 10 rows :
select * from Occupancies LIMIT 10

selecting columns by name
select col_a, col_b from table_name 


Grab the latest 200 rows
select CTime, Path from ( select * from Occupancies order by id desc limit 200 ) sub order by id asc


Looks like the names of the hosts are in the Hosts table. To show them:
select id, Name from Hosts order by id asc





Grab the latest 200 rows
select CTime, Host, Path from ( select * from Occupancies order by id desc limit 2000 ) sub where Path like "0349-150018%" order by id asc

Test filter by date
select id,CTime, Host, Threat from Occupancies where CTime >= '2018-06-12' AND CTime < '2018-06-13'

Test filter by date and host
select id,CTime, Host, Threat from Occupancies where CTime >= '2018-06-13' AND CTime < '2018-06-14' AND Host = 1

select Threat, count(*) as num_threats from Occupancies where CTime >= '2018-06-19' AND CTime < '2018-06-20' AND Host = 1 group by Threat


Group IDSummary
select IDSummary, count(*) as num_threats from Occupancies where CTime >= '2018-06-19' AND CTime < '2018-06-20' AND Host = 1 group by IDSummary
