## Configuring a DHCP server on Ubuntu

We wish to configure a DHCP service on an interface attached to the following subnet: 192.168.1.0. The interface (server) will be at 192.168.1.10 and addresses will be allocated to clients in the range: 192.168.1.150 to 192.168.1.200.

The dhcp server is provided by isc-dhcp-server.service which can be installed using the following (debian):
sudo apt-get install isc-dhcp-server

# DHCP Configuration
The configuration file for the DHCP deamon is located at /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf. Here is an example configuration file:

ddns-update-style none;
authoritative;
default-lease-time 600;
max-lease-time 7200;
subnet 192.168.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
 range 192.168.1.150 192.168.1.200;
}


# Bind the DHCP server to an interface / interfaces
The DHCP server must be told which network interface to listen on, to do ths edit the file /etc/default/isc-dhcp-server and set the following
INTERFACESv4="eth0 eth1"
Each network interface is specified in a list delimited by a space.

# Set the address of the network interface
To relate subnet specification(s) to the network interface(s), each interface must be given an address in on the subnet 




## Debug and logging:
The logs for isc-dhcp-server.service are sent to syslog. To view (and follow) them use the following command:
journalctl -u isc-dhcp-server.service -f
