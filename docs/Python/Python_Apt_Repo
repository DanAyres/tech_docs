# Add the deadsnakes repository
this wiil provide access to many python 3 versions including the new 3.9 :)

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
sudo apt-get update


To do anything useful, we also need pip as well as python
sudo apt install python3.7
sudo apt install python3-pip


To make virtual environments for python the virtualenv package is also required
sudo apt-get install python3.X-venv
pip install virtualenv


(Didn't need this in the end)
There is some sort of bug with creating virtual environment with pip, see link below

python -m venv foo --without-pip
source foo/bin/activate
curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py | python
